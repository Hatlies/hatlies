        <h1>Hatlies NFT Collection</h1>
        <p>Inspired by the resilience and positivity of my mother, who has been battling cancer since 2021, I have created the Hatlies collection. Each Hatlie is unique, with her own personal style and story. They serve as a reminder to us all to never give up and always find beauty and positivity.</p>
