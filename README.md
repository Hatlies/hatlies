# 🎩 Hatlies NFT Collection

Welcome to the Hatlies NFT Collection GitHub page! Our collection is inspired by the resilience and positivity of my mother, who has been battling cancer since 2021. Each Hatlie wears a unique hat, symbolizing support for those who are battling cancer or for those who are supporting a loved one through their journey. 🌟
